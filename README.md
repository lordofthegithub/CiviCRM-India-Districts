# CiviCRM-India-Districts
Districts of India which is equivalent to US Counties; a sub jurisdiction under the States.

This repository mimics what Andrew Hunt at AGH Strategies created for United States Counties. 
Necessary edits to the Arrays and IDs of states have been done; functions have also been relabeled.
Havent yet tested in any environment. Invited @AGH1 to give it a whirl in order to ensure that the 
extension is created and released similar to US Counties. Many thanks to his original efforts.
